Assignment 1
==============

Task 1
--------
Heartbeat is an extension for the TLS implementation of OpenSSL.  It is used to
see if the connection to a server is still alive.  This is done by sending any
data and the server will send the same information back.  The bug is that
Heartbeat won't check if the quoted length of the sent data and the real length
of the sent data match.  If this differs, Heartbeat might copy too much data
from the buffer, so that it sends content from the local memory.  The attacker
can get up to 64KB of the RAM and even increase the size of stolen data by
sending multiple requests.

Task 2
--------
Denial-of-Service attack (DoS)

During a DoS attack a server receives very many requests and might even give up
serving any data.  The attacker could use only one computer and establish many
connections from this computer to flood the server or use many computers, where
each establish many or even only some connections to the server. The last method
is called DDoS.

Gihub 2015
Coders, researcher and research instituts as well use github and might have been
affected.  Information about this attack have been distributed on several online
magazines such as heise and are trustful.

Task 3
--------
see source code

.htpasswd is a file for Apache server that contains a set of username and
password (username:password) in .htaccess the admin can define that this
user:password must be entered to have access to folder and files.  The username
is stored in clear text, the password encrypted (c crypt)

This htpasswd defines two username:password sets.
netsec_temp with the password from lecture.
netsec with password "torturous"

Task 4
--------
a)
    1.  RockYou is an app and game company, that was hacked in 2009.
        32.603.388 passwords were stolen, all have been stored in clear text
        before.

    2.  Many users have the same password.
        32.603.388 were stolen
        14.344.391 are unique
        2,27 people use the same password in average. Probably many have unique
        passwords and some passwords are used by much more people.

        Most Passwords in the list contain names, real words and sequences of
        letters or numbers and have a size from around 8-10 characters.

    3.  Strong passwords are quite long, contain many different characters, no
        names or words and no sequences, It is harder to guess/test a password that
        is more complex, because there are much more possibilities that you have to
        test and each takes a little while.  Everything that could help the hacker,
        like a list of all English words, should be considered, so that the own
        password is nothing that appears in that.  Weak passwords don't follow these
        rules. This could be a word or a name, in worst case something that is
        associated with the user, like the own name or the name of some related
        person or a hobby.

b)
    Let n be the number of characters that could be used to define a password and l be the length of the password
    Options to build passwords with this length: n^l
    E.g.:
        26^5 = 11.881.376
        26^7 = 8.031.810.176
        52^5 = 380.204.032
        52^7 = 10.280.717.030.000
    The more letters the more combinations, the longer the more combinations.
